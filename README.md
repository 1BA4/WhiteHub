# WhiteHub

 ###### A white touch to the official HumHub theme of HumHub 1.1.1

Note: *I modified little bit of the less file to make it whitish & clean . The original blue bar at the top looked a bit old for me. So small amount of css  code was added .*

Instructions:

1. Just paste it alongside `Humhub` folder in `document_root/themes`
2. Toggle it from the `administration setting -> settings -> appearance` :wink:

The less file may look lazily modified ​:smile:​
